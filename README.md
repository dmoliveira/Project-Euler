# Project Euler
Author: [Diego Marinho de Oliveira](http://www.github.com/dmoliveira)

## Introduction
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. In this repo I intent to create efficient and creative solutions for the problems that compose Project Euler. Please, look for my solution in Python, Julia, R, C++ or other relevant programming language.
